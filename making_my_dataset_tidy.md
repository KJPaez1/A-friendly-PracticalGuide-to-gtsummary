# Making my data tidy: ready to analyze
Before to beggin to explore your data, it should have a _standard_ structure that 
is going to make easy the downstream analysis, visualization, and modelling. In short, 
before you analyse your data, you need to make your data a _tidy data_.

### Refreshing termns and their concepts
Before to beggin to talk about data and their organizations, we should get familiar with some terms.
There are three terms that are important because all data have them: Observations, Variables, and Values
* Observations are the individual who are part of your study populations. For example, patients or students.
* Variables are the things that you are measuring from your observations. For example, smoking status, or glucose level.
* Values are the possible _answers_ to your variables. For example, for smoking status the answer could be: yes or no; for glucose level, the answer could be: 95 mg/dL or 100 mg/dL 

### Data have different looks
After data have been collected, it can be structucted in different ways.
The example bellow shows two way in which the same Data can be structured: in data 1 rows observations (patients) and columns are variables; 
in Data 2 thing are inverted, rows are variables and columns are observations.
