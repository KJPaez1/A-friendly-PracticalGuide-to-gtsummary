# A-friendly-PracticalGuide-to-gtsummary
This tutorial is aimed to users with no prior experience in RStudio. I will try to guide you giving you detailed description of how to adapt the scripts needed to generate high-quality tables with gtsummary package.
Although the material here can be used to different data types, it will be more useful for investigators in clinical research with observational designs.

## Order in which this tutorial should be taken
1. First install R, then install RStudio. You can look at this tutorial [here](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=C81D985EEA5E1598%21s5acbebbcb91d49ce99ea0ddda7682892&cid=C81D985EEA5E1598)
2. To give the correct structure to your data read the file named [making_my_dataset_tidy](https://github.com/KJPaez1/A-friendly-PracticalGuide-to-gtsummary/blob/main/making_my_dataset_tidy.md)
3. Read about the data (cardiovascular_risk_data) that is going the be used for the examples: 
4. To work with order, we should apply some tips. Read the following to create a project (you can think of this as a folder where everything is going to be stored) into RStudio:
For the next step, you can chose one of the two tutorial (scritps) depending on the design of your study. Both scripts make use of the same data.
